Assignment 1



Description:


This program uses user inputs and text files to act as a database.
The user can specify the location of a database (in the form of a .txt file) and then read and write student information to it. 
There are six options when the program starts:
	add a student to the database
	open/read a database
	save changes to the current database
	display the information on a specific student (identified by the students ID)
	grade a student based on their year marks
	quit the program.


To run:
	1. Navigate to the directory of the downloaded file in the terminal.
	
2. Type "make clean" to get rid of any compiled files should they exist.
	
3. Type "make" to compile the code.
	
4. Type "make run" to run the program.
	
5. Follow the on screen instructions.



Note: create a text file in a known location to act as a database. I have included my existing database file "tempData.txt" should you wish to use this for testing.
